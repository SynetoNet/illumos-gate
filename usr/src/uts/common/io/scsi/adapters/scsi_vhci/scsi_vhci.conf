#BEGIN: FAILOVER_MODULE_BLOCK (DO NOT MOVE OR DELETE)
#
# Declare scsi_vhci failover module paths with 'ddi-forceload' so that
# they get loaded early enough to be available for scsi_vhci root use.
#
# NOTE: Correct operation depends on the value of 'ddi-forceload', this
# value should not be changed. The ordering of entries is from
# most-specific failover modules (with a "probe" implementation that is
# completely VID/PID table based), to most generic (failover modules that
# are based on T10 standards like TPGS). By convention the last part of a
# failover module path, after "/scsi_vhci_", is called the
# "failover-module-name", which begins with "f_" (like "f_asym_sun"). The
# "failover-module-name" is also used in the override mechanism below.
ddi-forceload =
	"misc/scsi_vhci/scsi_vhci_f_asym_sun",
	"misc/scsi_vhci/scsi_vhci_f_asym_lsi",

#
# For a device that has a GUID, discovered on a pHCI with mpxio enabled, vHCI
# access also depends on one of the scsi_vhci failover modules accepting the
# device.  The default way this occurs is by a failover module's "probe"
# implementation (sfo_device_probe) indicating the device is supported under
# scsi_vhci.  To override this default probe-oriented configuration in
# order to
#
#    1)	establish support for a device not currently accepted under scsi_vhci
#
# or 2)	override the module selected by "probe"
#
# or 3)	disable scsi_vhci support for a device
#
# you can add a 'scsi-vhci-failover-override' tuple, as documented in
# scsi_get_device_type_string(9F). For each tuple, the first part provides
# basic device identity information (vid/pid) and the second part selects
# the failover module by "failover-module-name". If you want to disable
# scsi_vhci support for a device, use the special failover-module-name "NONE".
# Currently, for each failover-module-name in 'scsi-vhci-failover-override'
# (except "NONE") there needs to be a
# "misc/scsi_vhci/scsi_vhci_<failover-module-name>" in 'ddi-forceload' above.
